            <h2 class="greeting">Hello, my name is Austin Jones</h2>
            <h3>I am a full-stack software engineer located in New Orleans, Louisiana.</h3>
            <p>I first recognized I have a passion for programming when I realized I enjoy technical problem-solving.</p>
            <p>
                As an engineer, I:
                <ul>
                    <li>Am able to compartmentalize code to solve problems.</li>
                    <li>Learn new technologies and methods often.</li>
                    <li>Like to teach other engineers, and vice versa, be enlightened by them.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>About Austin</h2>
            <p>
                From my very first line of code, I've been hooked. Since then, I have found that I mostly enjoy problem-solving with general purpose programming languages. My favorite right now is JavaScript. I am currently studying with Thinkful in their Engineering
                Immersion program. If you would like to collaborate on something, please feel free to contact me!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy working out, reading non-fiction, watching dramas and animes, listening to music, and hanging out with my fiance and daughter. One day I will discover a way to do all five at the same time! Don't tell me it's not possible - 2020
